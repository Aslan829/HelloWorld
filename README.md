# Overview

This is a classic Hello World file. The purpose of this project was to set up my IDE on Visual Studio Code and connect it to GitHub.

When the Python file is run, it will print the text phrase "Hello Rexburg".

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
